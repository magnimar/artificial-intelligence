# AI projects

These are my personal AI projects.

## sin

Simple regressional neural network which takes in one output and predicts the sine of that output. Input into the model is a sinus wave with some noise.

## student_grades

Regressional neural network which takes in many inputs (approx 59) and predicts the final grade of a student. Input into the model is a dataset of student grades. Uses one hot encoding for categorical data.
